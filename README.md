- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Theophilus Ebuka Odoh.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in the Optimization and control of renewable energy-integrated electrical power grid, Machine Learning verification and applications in power systems, Cyberphysical power system
- ðŸ”­ I am currently a trainee engineer in control, Insrumentation and automation department at Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals (DPRP) in Nigeria, My unit is Offsite/Gantry/Control room 04.
- Milestone: I helped in commissioning the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) gantry truck loading area.
- Present Duties: I provide operational support to ensure swift operation in the gantry by attending to issues concerning the batch controller unit (BCU), Card reader (CR), Mass flow meter (MFM), Earthing relay and overspill interlocks. I help automate the loading process from the control room using the distributed control system and in the collection of data from the BCU, CR and MFM through the junction bus signals, field and control room networking panels for operation monitoring and record tracking. I also attend to Motor-Operated Valve (MOV) issues in the tank farm area.

- ðŸ”­ I am passionate about research in electrical power systems and power electronics thus I am part of the Center for Power Systems Dynamic Simulation working under Dr. Aliyu Sabo at the Nigeria Defence Academy. Most of our collaborative efforts are on this page with present focus on machine learning application in inverter dominated electrical power grids and power electronics.
- âœ¨ I am skilled in MATLAB-Simulink, LaTeX, Arduino, Distributed Control System, Webots, AutoCAD, Microsoft Visio, Printed Circuit Board design and layout 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Recently I worked on a project: automobile surveillance, object recognition and obstacle avoidance robot using Webots, Python and C++, Which is posted here
