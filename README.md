- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Theophilus Ebuka Odoh.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in Optimization and control of renewable energy integrated electrical power grid, Machine Learning verification and applications in the power systems, Cyberphysical       power system
- ðŸ”­ I currently a trainee engineer in control, Insrumentation and automation department at Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals (DPRP) in Nigeria, My unit is Offsite/Gantry/Control room 04. Here I helped in commissioning the Premium motor spirit (PMS) truck loading area, presently I provide operational support to ensure swift operation by attending to issues concerning the batch controller unit (BCU), Card reader (CR), Mass flow meter (MFM), Earthing relay and overspill interlocks. I also help in automating the loading process from the control room using the distributed control system and collection of data from the BCU, CR and MFM through the juction bus signals, field and control room networking panels.
- ðŸ”­ I am passionate about research in electrical power systems and power electronics thus I am part of the center for power systems dynamics simulations collaborating with Dr. Aliyu Sabo at Nigeria Defence Academy. Most of our collaborative efforts are on this page with present focus on machine learning application in inverter dominated electrical power grids and power electronics.
- âœ¨ I am skilled in MATLAB-Simulink, LaTeX, Arduino, Distributed Control System, Webots, AutoCAD, Microsoft Visio, Printed Circuit Board design and layout 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Recently I worked on the project: automobile surveillance, object recognition and obstacle avoidance robot using Webots and Python. I will post the project here in coming weeks
