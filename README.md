- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Theophilus Ebuka Odoh.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in the Optimization and control of renewable energy-integrated electrical power grid, Machine Learning verification and applications in power systems, Cyberphysical power system
- ðŸ”­ I am currently a trainee engineer in control, Insrumentation and automation department at Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals (DPRP) in Nigeria, My unit is Offsite/Gantry/Control room 04.
- Milestone: I helped in commissioning the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) gantry truck loading area.
- Present Duties: I provide operational support to ensure swift operation in the gantry by attending to issues concerning the batch controller unit (BCU), Card reader (CR), Mass flow meter (MFM), Earthing relay and overspill interlocks. I help automate the loading process from the control room. In addition, I provide operational support through the distributed control system for monitoring and control of product tank farm area and I do attend to Motor-Operated Valve (MOV) issues in the tank farm area.
- ðŸ”­ I am passionate about research in electrical power systems and power electronics, From August 2022 to November 2023 I worked physically as a research assistant at the Center for Power Systems Dynamic Simulation under Dr. Aliyu Sabo at the Nigerian Defence Academy Kaduna (From December 2023 to date, I worked remotely because I moved from Kaduna to Lagos state), I carried out my masters thesis research in this center and subsequently worked on two research projects focused on "Power system modelling, renewable energy integration and damping controller design". Most of our research works are on this page with present focus on machine learning application in inverter dominated electrical power grids and power electronics.
- âœ¨ I am skilled in MATLAB-Simulink, LaTeX, Arduino, Distributed Control System, Webots, AutoCAD, Microsoft Visio, Printed Circuit Board design and layout 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Recently I worked on a project: automobile surveillance, object recognition and obstacle avoidance robot using Webots, Python and C++, Which is posted here
